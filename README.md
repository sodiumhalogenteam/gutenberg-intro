## tutorials I found most helpful
- [Free demos from Zac Gordon's Gutenberg course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOP0dPzH9mo&list=PLruo2gSoqlegqehfUbOMEbpUborFIaNsD) - He does an awesome job explaining the details. Start by watching through these.
- [This is good if you want to read something](https://deliciousbrains.com/custom-gutenberg-block/) - it skips some important details though, but the video above covers what this skips.

## dev toolkits
- [create-guten-block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block) - similar to create-react-app. This comes with everything you need to make a block, and also has babel, eslint, and a few other helpful tools added.
